[b]Wingman[/b] is a powerful desktop companion application specifically crafted for Discovery Freelancer. Intended to be a modern addition to the venerable [url=http://adoxa.altervista.org/freelancer/tools.html#flstat]FLStat[/url] and [url=http://wiz0u.free.fr/prog/flc/]Freelancer Companion[/url], it seeks to bring a wealth of new features to the community.

[b]Wingman features:[/b]
[list]
[*] [i]Navmap:[/i] a beautiful navigation aid integrating and extending @"Error"'s [url=https://github.com/AudunVN/Navmap]Online Navmap[/url]
[*] [i]Merchant:[/i] a powerful trading assistant
[*] [i]Roster:[/i] a record of your in-game characters and their attributes
[*] [i]Database:[/i] an information-dense overview of the game's world
[*] Augmentation of the game client, including clipboard access, named screenshots and new commands
[*] Display of infocards with full rich text formatting, and TGA icons
[*] Full cross-platform support, with downloads for Windows and Linux
[/list]

See [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman#launchpad]here[/url] for a list of features I am currently planning on adding in future. Please feel free to make your own suggestions! Wingman is intended to be community-led.

Wingman is free software, released under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0.


[/pi][anchor=download][sp2][a=download][img=12x12]https://i.imgur.com/fjTg0Y7.png[/img][/a][/sp2] [size=15][color=#66CCFF]Downloads & installation[/color][/size][pi amount=1]

[list]
[*] [size=medium][color=#FFB600]Windows 7+[/color][/size]
The application is built as a self-contained executable on Windows:


[list]
[*] [b]Download and run the installer:[/b] [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman/releases/download/v0.1/wingman-0.1-setup.exe][font=monospace]wingman-0.1-setup.exe[/font] (50.3 MB)[/url]
[*] [b]Or download a portable distribution:[/b] [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman/releases/download/v0.1/wingman-0.1-portable.zip][font=monospace]wingman-0.1-portable.zip[/font] (68.5 MB)[/url]
[/list]

[u]On Windows, administrative privileges are required[/u] to read the process memory of, and inject keyboard input into, Freelancer, so the application will ask for them before launching. I hope to improve this experience in future by restarting when features requiring these permissions are turned on.


[*] [size=medium][color=#FFB600]Linux[/color][/size]
Python 3.7 or higher is must be installed. Assuming your Python 3.7+ executable is available as [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]python3[/color][/font],

[b]This is a beta. There will be bugs![/b] You can report them in two ways: opening an [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman/issues]issue on GitHub[/url] or using the form below if you do not have an account:

[code]
[quote=Bug report]
[b]Operating system: [/b]
[b]Wingman version: [/b]
[b]Steps to reproduce: [/b]
[b]What did you expect to happen?: [/b]
[b]What happened?: [/b]
[/quote]
[/code]

If the bug causes the application to crash, add [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]wingman.log[/color][/font] as an attachment to your post or issue. On Windows you can find this file in [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\wingman[/color][/font].

In either case, please check that the exact bug has not been listed already in this thread or in [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman/issues]issues[/url] to avoid duplicate reports.

If the application crashes immediately when it starts, the first thing to try is deleting [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]wingman.cfg[/color][/font] in the above directory. Even if this resolves the issue, please still submit a bug report explaining what led up to the crash!

Because this is a beta, it's a good idea to back up your character information in Roster periodically if you want to hold on to this information. You can do this using the Export button.
