[b]This is a beta. There will be bugs![/b] You can report them in two ways: opening an [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman/issues]issue on GitHub[/url] or using the form below if you do not have an account:

[code]
[quote=Bug report]
[b]Operating system: [/b]
[b]Wingman version: [/b]
[b]Steps to reproduce: [/b]
[b]What did you expect to happen?: [/b]
[b]What happened?: [/b]
[/quote]
[/code]

If the bug causes the application to crash, add [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]wingman.log[/color][/font] as an attachment to your post or issue. On Windows you can find this file in [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\wingman[/color][/font].

In either case, please check that the exact bug has not been listed already in this thread or in [url=https://github.com/biqqles/wingman/issues]issues[/url] to avoid duplicate reports.

If the application crashes immediately when it starts, the first thing to try is deleting [font=monospace][color=#91ad9f]wingman.cfg[/color][/font] in the above directory. Even if this resolves the issue, please still submit a bug report explaining what led up to the crash!

Because this is a beta, it's a good idea to back up your character information in Roster periodically if you want to hold on to this information. You can do this using the Export button.
